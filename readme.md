## Reproducible Publications with Python and Quarto

Presentation for PyData Global: <https://global2022.pydata.org/cfp/talk/XGJUPX/>

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication. The system has support for reproducible embedded computations, equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more. In this talk we'll explore the use of Quarto with Python, describing both integration with IPython/Jupyter and the Quarto VS Code extension.
